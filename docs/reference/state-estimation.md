## What is a state-space model with output?

All state-space models we have seen so far have had this form:

$$\dot{x} = Ax+Bu$$

From now on, we will consider state-space models with this form instead:

$$\begin{align*} \dot{x} &= Ax + Bu \\ y &= Cx + Du \end{align*}$$

We have added one more variable (along with the state $x$ and the input $u$):

* $y$ is the **output**.

Like the state and the input, the output is a function of time --- we will write $y(t)$ when we want to make the time-dependence explicit --- and may have more than one element, so is in general a vector (represented by a matrix of numbers). Suppose, in particular, that

* the output $y$ has $n_y$ elements.

Then, we would represent it as a column matrix:

$$y = \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_{n_y} \end{bmatrix}.$$

Like $A$ and $B$, the constants $C$ and $D$ have to be matrices:

* $C$ is a constant matrix of size $n_y \times n_x$.
* $D$ is a constant matrix of size $n_y \times n_u$.

The state-space model remains both **linear** and **time-invariant**, because $y$ is a linear function of $x$ and $u$ and because $C$ and $D$ are constant.

Outputs can be used to model a variety of different things. We will use them to model sensor measurements for the purpose of state estimation.


## How do I linearize a sensor model?

You already know how to [linearize a dynamic model](state-space-models#how-do-i-put-a-system-in-state-space-form):

*   Rewrite the dynamic model as a set of first-order ODEs:

    $$\dot{m} = f(m, n)$$

*   Choose an equilibrium point $m_e, n_e$ among the solutions to this equation:

    $$0 = f(m_e, n_e)$$

*   Define the state and input in terms of the equilibrium point:

    $$x = m - m_e \qquad\qquad u = n - n_e$$

*   Compute $A$ and $B$ as the Jacobian of $f$ with respect to $m$ and $n$ respectively, evaluated at the equilibrium point:

    $$
    A = \frac{\partial f}{\partial m}\biggr\rvert_{(m_{e},n_{e})}
    \qquad\qquad
    B = \frac{\partial f}{\partial n}\biggr\rvert_{(m_{e},n_{e})}
    $$

The result is a linear approximation

$$\dot{x} = Ax + Bu$$

to the nonlinear dynamic model

$$\dot{m} = f(m, n)$$

that is accurate near the equilibrium point.

We can use the same process to linearize a sensor model:

**Step 1.** Rewrite the sensor model as follows:

$$o = g(m, n).$$

In this expression, the variable $o$ is a vector of sensor measurements. It is a function of time and can have more than one element --- so, just like $m$ and $n$, it should be represented as a column matrix. Just like the function $f(m, n)$ that describes the dynamic model, the function $g(m, n)$ that describes the sensor model will often be nonlinear.

**Step 2.** Define the output as follows:

$$y = o - g(m_e, n_e).$$

Note that $y$ measures the *difference* between what the sensor measurements are and what these measurements would be if the system were at equilibrium. In particular, the output is *zero* when the system is at equilibrium even if the measurements are not.

> It is important to understand, however, that $o_e$ is **not** an "equilibrium value" in the same way that $m_e$ and $n_e$ are. The key difference is that $m_e$ and $n_e$ are **chosen**, while $o_e$ is **computed** (by evaluating the function $g$ at $m_e$ and $n_e$).

**Step 3.** Compute $C$ and $D$ as follows:

$$
C = \frac{\partial g}{\partial m}\biggr\rvert_{(m_{e},n_{e})}
\qquad\qquad
D = \frac{\partial g}{\partial n}\biggr\rvert_{(m_{e},n_{e})}.
$$

Why does this make sense? Just like we took a first-order [Taylor's series expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) about $m_e, n_e$ to approximate the function $f(m, n)$ that describes the dynamic model, let's take a first-order series expansion about $m_e, n_e$ to approximate the function $g(m, n)$ that describes the sensor model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y
&= o - g(m_e, n_e) \\
&= g(m, n) - g(m_e, n_e) \\
&\approx \left( g(m_e, n_e) + \frac{\partial g}{\partial m}\biggr\rvert_{(m_{e},n_{e})} \left( m - m_e \right) + \frac{\partial g}{\partial n}\biggr\rvert_{(m_{e},n_{e})} \left( n - n_e \right) \right) - g(m_e, n_e) \\
&= \frac{\partial g}{\partial m}\biggr\rvert_{(m_{e},n_{e})} \left( m - m_e \right) + \frac{\partial g}{\partial n}\biggr\rvert_{(m_{e},n_{e})} \left( n - n_e \right) \\
&= C x + D u
\end{aligned}
$$

So, with this choice of $C$ and $D$, we have produced a linear approximation

$$y = Cx + Du$$

to the nonlinear sensor model

$$o = g(m, n)$$

that is accurate near the equilibrium point.

### Example (linear sensor model)

Consider again a system with the following dynamic model:

$$\ddot{q} + 3\sin q = \tau.$$

[We already showed](state-space-models#example-second-order) how to rewrite this dynamic model as

$$
\begin{bmatrix} \dot{q} \\ \dot{v} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v \\ -3\sin q + \tau \end{bmatrix}
$$

and how to linearize it about the equilibrium point

$$
q_e = \pi / 2 \qquad v_e = 0 \qquad \tau_e = 3
$$

to produce the state-space model

$$
\dot{x} = Ax+Bu
$$

where

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}
\qquad\qquad
B = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

and

$$
x = \begin{bmatrix} q - q_e \\ v - v_e \end{bmatrix} \qquad\qquad u = \begin{bmatrix}\tau - \tau_e\end{bmatrix}.
$$

Now suppose we have sensors that allow the measurement of

$$q.$$

Let's apply our method to put this measurement in state-space form.

First, we rewrite the measurement in the form $o = g(m, n)$, i.e., as a vector-valued function of $m$ and $n$:

$$
o
=
\begin{bmatrix} q \end{bmatrix}.
$$



Then, we define the output as the difference between the value of this function and what the value would be at equilibrium:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y
&= o - g\left( \begin{bmatrix} q_e \\ v_e \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} \tau_e \end{bmatrix} \right) \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} q \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} q_e \end{bmatrix} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} q - q_e \end{bmatrix} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} q - (\pi / 2) \end{bmatrix} .
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, we compute $C$ and $D$ by taking Jacobians:

$$
\begin{aligned}
C
&= \frac{\partial g}{\partial \begin{bmatrix} q \\ v \end{bmatrix}}\biggr\rvert_{\left(\begin{bmatrix}q_e\\v_e\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{e}\end{bmatrix}\right)} \\
&= \left.\begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{\partial(q)}{\partial q} & \dfrac{\partial(q)}{\partial v} \end{bmatrix}\right\rvert_{\left(\begin{bmatrix}q_e\\v_e\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{e}\end{bmatrix}\right)} \\
&= \left.\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\right\rvert_{\left(\begin{bmatrix}q_e\\v_e\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{e}\end{bmatrix}\right)} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \\[1em]
D
&= \frac{\partial g}{\partial \begin{bmatrix} \tau \end{bmatrix}}\biggr\rvert_{\left(\begin{bmatrix}q_e\\v_e\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{e}\end{bmatrix}\right)} \\
&= \left.\begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{\partial(q)}{\partial \tau} \end{bmatrix}\right\rvert_{\left(\begin{bmatrix}q_e\\v_e\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{e}\end{bmatrix}\right)} \\
&= \left.\begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix}\right\rvert_{\left(\begin{bmatrix}q_e\\v_e\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{e}\end{bmatrix}\right)} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

The resulting state-space model is

$$
\begin{aligned}
y &= Cx + Du \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}x + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix}u.
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the original sensor model was linear, so there was no approximation here. We could probably have skipped the entire process of linearization and written the system in state-space form by inspection. However, just as was true when putting dynamic models in state-space form (see [example](state-space-models#example-first-order)), it is nice to know that "linearization" still works even in this simple case.

### Example (nonlinear sensor model)

Consider a system with the [same dynamic model as before](#example-linear-sensor-model), but now suppose we have sensors that allow the measurement of

$$\dfrac{\cos q}{\sin q}.$$

Again, let's apply our method to put this measurement in state-space form.

First, we rewrite the measurement in the form $o = g(m, n)$, i.e., as a vector-valued function of $m$ and $n$:

$$
o
=
\begin{bmatrix} \cos q / \sin q \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Then, we define the output as the difference between the value of this function and what the value would be at equilibrium:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y
&= o - g\left( \begin{bmatrix} q_e \\ v_e \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} \tau_e \end{bmatrix} \right) \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} \cos q / \sin q \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} \cos q_e / \sin q_e \end{bmatrix} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} (\cos q / \sin q) - (\cos q_e / \sin q_e) \end{bmatrix} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} \cos q / \sin q \end{bmatrix}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, we compute $C$ and $D$ by taking Jacobians:

$$
\begin{aligned}
C
&= \frac{\partial g}{\partial \begin{bmatrix} q \\ v \end{bmatrix}}\biggr\rvert_{\left(\begin{bmatrix}q_e\\v_e\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{e}\end{bmatrix}\right)} \\
&= \left.\begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{\partial(\cos q / \sin q)}{\partial q} & \dfrac{\partial(\cos q / \sin q)}{\partial v} \end{bmatrix}\right\rvert_{\left(\begin{bmatrix}q_e\\v_e\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{e}\end{bmatrix}\right)} \\
&= \left.\begin{bmatrix} -1 / (\sin q)^2 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\right\rvert_{\left(\begin{bmatrix}q_e\\v_e\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{e}\end{bmatrix}\right)} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \\[1em]
D
&= \frac{\partial g}{\partial \begin{bmatrix} \tau \end{bmatrix}}\biggr\rvert_{\left(\begin{bmatrix}q_e\\v_e\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{e}\end{bmatrix}\right)} \\
&= \left.\begin{bmatrix} \dfrac{\partial(\cos q / \sin q)}{\partial \tau} \end{bmatrix}\right\rvert_{\left(\begin{bmatrix}q_e\\v_e\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{e}\end{bmatrix}\right)} \\
&= \left.\begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix}\right\rvert_{\left(\begin{bmatrix}q_e\\v_e\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}\tau_{e}\end{bmatrix}\right)} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

The resulting state-space model is

$$
\begin{aligned}
y &= Cx + Du \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}x + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix}u.
\end{aligned}
$$

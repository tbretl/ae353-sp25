## AIAA Format

| Label | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| M1 | All equations should be numbered in parentheses flush right. |
| M2 | The number of significant figures (or digits after the decimal place) should be both consistent and reasonable. |
| M3 | Inline equations must not be taller than the standard line height. If they are, make them block equations. |

| M10 | Dots should be centered over variables, not also over subscripts or superscripts. |
| M11 | Variables should be denoted by symbols and not by names that are used in python code. |
| M12 | Names of units (whether or not they are abbreviated) should be non-italic. |
| M13 | Names of matrices or vectors should not appear in brackets (only the elements of matrices or vectors should appear that way). |

## Content

| Label | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| C1 | When describing performance, either use words that are widely understood to have a precise technical meaning or provide a definition yourself (i.e., say what you mean). |
| C2 | Use an italic upper-case "K" to denote the gain matrix for linear state feedback (unless you clearly explain some alternative notation). |
| C3 | Incorrect description of the system to be controlled. |
| C4 | Specify both the "of what" and "with respect to what" when talking about derivatives (including Jacobians). |
| C5 | The abstract should provide a summary of key results (usually quantitative) that were obtained. Placeholders can be used in drafts when final results aren't available yet. |
| C6 | Do not provide unnecessary information about the computer, programming language, application, etc., that you used for implementation. |
| C7 | Theory should be in the Theory section, not also in the Introduction. |
| C8 | Provide enough information about the system to be controlled (including a clear description, a schematic, and a citation, for example) so that readers will understand even if they have not previously seen or worked with that system. |
| C9 | Linear state feedback should be negative (i.e., "-Kx" and not "Kx") unless you clearly explain why you are taking a non-standard approach. |
| C10 | Either follow the four-step process to put a system in state space form that is described on the reference pages of the course website (in exactly the order that is suggested) or clearly explain and justify whatever alternative approach you are taking. |
| C11 | Our method of deriving a state space model requires linearizing about an equilibrium point that is both constant and known in advance. Any other method should be clearly explained and justified. |
| C12 | Justify your choice of equilibrium point (making clear if other equilibrium points exist or if yours was the only possible choice). |
| C13 | Be specific enough about your methods so that another engineer could reproduce them. |
| C14 | Only the real or imaginary part of an eigenvalue can be positive or negative, not the eigenvalue itself. |
| C15 | The choice of the gain matrix K and/or the rationale behind it are missing. |
| C16 | The abstract should be self-contained and provide a clear yet concise description of the purpose of the work, the methods applied, and the results (preferably quantitative), along with the conclusion presented objectively. |
| C17 | Do not provide unnecessary information for the introduction. |
| C18 | Incorrect conclusion that the system won't be asymptotically stable. |
| C19 | Specify what the new term refers to or consider adding a reference to support the example. |
| C20 | The provided feedback controller doesn't have outputs. |
| C21 | A nonlinear function cannot be identical to its linearized function. |
| C22 | Do not use F as a linearized function since it's already used for F(q). |
| C23 | Introduce a new variable before using it unless it is defined in the nomenclature. |
| C24 | Use specific criteria instead of subjective terms (i.e., good or bad). |
| C25 | Do not provide too much details about the following sections in the introduction. |
| C26 | In general, do not restate what has been said before unless summarizing main points in the conclusion. |
| C27 | Explicitly write out all matrices (i.e. their entries as numerical values). |
| C28 | Describe what A and B refer to by using widely accepted academic terms like “system matrix” and “input matrix”, or explain their physical meaning, rather than just calling them “matrices”. |
| C29 | Introduction should prepare the reader to understand the rest of your report and how it fits within a broader context. |
| C30 | Explicitly state values being plugged in. |
| C31 | Do not explain specific system details in the abstract without context, as it may confuse readers unfamiliar with the system. |
| C32 | Write out the full equations of motion. |
| C33 | x and u are the state space vector and input vector, not m and n. |
| C34 | The abstract does not align with the main body. (e.g., Some results mentioned in the abstract are not presented in the experimental results section.) |
| C35 | This content would go in the Theory section rather than Experimental Results. |
| C36 | Provide more details about the method you introduce, including the underlying theory. |
| C37 | Nomenclature should include all relevant variables and their respective physical definitions.  |
| C38 | Use a widely accepted notation or define any new symbols clearly. |
| C39 | q is not position. It could be generalized position. |
| C40 | Definition of a variable is duplicated in the nomenclature. |
| C41 | Justify why the new term needs to be introduced (consider adding a reference to support, for instance). |
| C42 | Incomplete sentence or contents. |
| C43 | Incorrect or incomplete derivation of the ordinary differential equations describing the system. |
| C44 | Do not include any unfinished text in the report. |
| C45 | Explain why the eigenvalues must be real and should not have an imaginary part. |
| C46 | The gain matrix must have as many rows as there are inputs and as many columns as there are states. |

- TOC
{:toc }

These requirements may evolve during the semester.

## AIAA Format

| Label | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| A2 | There should be no additional lines between paragraphs. |
| A3 | All paragraphs (including in the abstract) should be indented the same amount, exactly the amount specified in the template. The only exception is the first sentence of the Introduction, which should not be indented. |
| A5 | You must choose either the word or latex template from AIAA and follow it exactly. |
| A8 | All equations must have one blank line above and below them. |
| A15 | There must not be watermarks or annotations (e.g., revision marks that result from tracking changes in Microsoft Word) that are not part of the AIAA template. |
| A17 | Code must be displayed as text in a code block (i.e., set apart from the rest of the text in a monospace font) and not, for example, as a screenshot or as text mixed in with the rest of the report. (Think carefully before you include code in your report, however — it is often better to share code in a different place, for example in the notebook that you are asked to submit as one of your final deliverables). |
| A23 | All text in the body of your report must be fully justified (aligned evenly along both the left and right margins). |
| A24 | All required sections must be present exactly once and follow the order specified in the guidelines (consistent with the AIAA template): Abstract, Nomenclature, Introduction, Theory, Experimental Methods, Results and Discussion, Conclusion, Appendix, Acknowledgements, and References. |
| A25 | The title of each section (other than the Appendix, Acknowledgements, and References — as well as the Abstract, which has no title) should be preceded by a Roman numeral corresponding to its order in the document. |
| A26 | Each page must be numbered and centered. |
| A28 | In the References section, each reference must be numbered. Each number must be enclosed in square brackets and be aligned at the left margin with no indent. All text of each reference must be indented (on the left) by exactly the same amount — that amount must be larger than the widest reference number. All references must consistently follow a well-established citation style (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago, IEEE, etc.). |
| A29 | All body text must be in the same font size. |
| A31 | Fonts for all text in the report (including section titles, for example) must be exactly the same — in terms of the name, size, and style — as in the AIAA template. |
| A36 | There must be an empty line between figure captions and paragraphs |
| A37 | There must not be an empty line between headings and the following text.  |
| A43 | Unlike all other sections, (1) the Abstract must be neither titled nor numbered, and (2) the Appendix, Acknowledgements, and References must not be numbered. |
| A45 | Reports must be at most six pages. |
| A46 | The right and left margins must be 1 inch for all text (including the nomenclature) except the abstract, in which both margins must be 1.5 inches. |
| A47 | Abstract text must be bold, exactly as in the template. |
| A49 | The report must have only one title. There must be no sub-titles (e.g., with additional information like the name or year of the class for which the report was submitted). |
| A50 | Full names (e.g., both first and last — spelled out and not simply as initials) must be given for each author. |
| A51 | There must be a blank line before each section title. |
| A53 | There must be an equals sign between each symbol and its definition in the Nomenclature. |
| A54 | Nomenclature must not contain subsections. |

| M1 | All equations should be numbered in parentheses flush right. |
| M2 | The number of significant figures (or digits after the decimal place) should be both consistent and reasonable. |
| M3 | Inline equations must not be taller than the standard line height. If they are, make them block equations. |
| M4 | Use symbols for Greek letters rather than spelling them out. |
| M5 | Place terms side by side when (1) denoting the multiplication of variables (e.g., C = AB instead of C = A×B or C = A*B), or (2) denoting the multiplication of a coefficient and a variable (e.g., y = 2x instead of y = 2×x or y = 2*x). |
| M6 | Variables should be italic. |
| M7 | Put indices, names, etc., of variables in subscripts or superscripts. |
| M8 | Words in equations — e.g., subscripts, superscripts, names of functions like "sin" or "cos", or words like "and" between different expressions — should be non-italic. |
| M9 | Remove unnecessary spaces between the equal sign and the variables/constants to maintain proper alignment and formatting. |
| M10 | Dots and hats should be centered over variables, not also over subscripts or superscripts. |
| M11 | Variables should be denoted by symbols and not by names that are used in python code. |
| M12 | Names of units (whether or not they are abbreviated) must be non-italic, must be separated by a space from the number, and (other than in the Nomenclature) must not be enclosed in parentheses or other delimiters particularly when accompanied by numbers or symbols. |
| M13 | Names of matrices or vectors should not appear in brackets (only the elements of matrices or vectors should appear that way). |
| M16 | Units must be correct. |
| M17 | Each matrix must be enclosed by a single pair of square brackets. |
| M18 | Numbers, whether in the text or Nomenclature, must be presented with units (e.g., "1.5 m" and not just "1.5"), unless these numbers are dimensionless, are elements of a matrix or vector, or are in a table that gives units in the row or column header. |
| M21 | Use "r x c" (where the "x" is a "\times" in latex) instead of "r * c" when describing the size of a matrix. |
| M22 | Use an overdot notation instead of a prime (apostrophe) for time derivatives. |
| M24 | Transposed matrices need a T superscript. |
| M31 | Multiplication of units must include either a dot or space between variables (e.g., ft•lb or ft lb, not ftlb or ft*lb or ft-lb). |
| M33 | Use appropriate notation (e.g., summation) instead of writing equations in text form. |
| M35 | Parentheses must be closed. |
| M38 | There must be enough space between elements of a matrix or vector so that it is clear they are separate elements and are not variables being multiplied. |
| M39 | Either present eigenvalues as elements of a list (e.g., "p = [-1 + 2j, -1 - 2j]") or as separate, named values (e.g., "s_1 = -1 + 2j \qquad s_2 = -1 - 2j") and not as elements of a vector (e.g., "p = \begin{bmatrix} -1 + 2j & -1 - 2j \end{bmatrix}"). |
| M40 | Equations must not have typos. |
| M43 | Equations must be centered. |
| M44 | Equations must be referenced as "Eq. (1)" within a sentence, or as "Equation (1)" at the beginning of a sentence, with the number in parentheses. Examples of incorrect references include "Eq. 1" (no parentheses), "Eq.(1)" (no space between the "Eq." and the "(1)", "Eq. ( 1)" (extra space inside the parentheses), etc. |
| M45 | Do not (1) use the same variable to denote two different things or (2) use two different variables to denote the same thing. |
| M46 | A subscript must be used to denote substitution of equilibrium values into a Jacobian matrix (e.g., $\frac{\partial f}{\partial m}\biggr\rvert_{m_e, n_e}$ not $\frac{\partial f}{\partial m}\biggr\rvert m_e, n_e$). |
| M47 | The font size of all text in equations should be both readable and close to the standard body text size. |
| M48 | There must be enough space between equations presented side-by-side in the same block so that it is clear that they are separate equations (e.g., "x = m - m_e \qquad u = n - n_e" and not "x = m - m_e u = n - n_e"). |
| M49 | Elements of a matrix or vector must be numbers or variables and cannot be equations (for example). |
| M50 | Elements of a matrix or vector must be separated by tabbed spaces and not by commas. |
| M51 | The notation used for vectors and matrices, whether in boldface or standard type, must be consistent throughout the report. |
| M52 | The use of "percent" and "%" must be consistent throughout the report. Unless there is a specific reason to do otherwise, use "%". |
| M53 | When listing variables, write them out (e.g., $w_x$, $w_y$, and $w_z$ instead of $w_{x,y,z}$) or use standard notations (e.g., $m_i$ where $i = 1, \dotsc, N$ or $m_1, \dotsc, m_N$). |
| M54 | Spell out operators and comparison symbols in the abstract (e.g., use "about" instead of "~", and "greater than" instead of ">"). |
| M55 | Matrix dimensions must be consistent within an equation (e.g., both sides of the equation must match). |


## Style

| Label | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| S1 | Spell out "and" rather than using an ampersand (i.e., the symbol "&"). |
| S2 | Use of apostrophes must be correct (e.g., before the "s" for singular possession, after the "s" for plural possession, etc.). |
| S3 | Do not use run-on sentences. |
| S4 | Do not use sentence fragments. |
| S6 | Indent the first line (but no other line) of each paragraph. |
| S7 | Block equations must be a part of the sentence and are subject to the same rules for grammar and punctuation as everything else. When presented alone, a block equation would be a sentence fragment. |
| S9 | Capitalization must be correct (e.g., do not capitalize words unnecessarily, always capitalize the first word of a sentence, etc.). |
| S10 | Spelling must be correct. |
| S11 | What comes before a colon or a semicolon must be a complete sentence. |
| S13 | Verb tense must be correct. |
| S19 | The word "this" should be followed by a noun (e.g., "this robot" or "this result"). The same is true for the words "these," "that" (when pointing to a noun as in "that robot"), and "those." |
| S20 | Do not denote items in a list with a "/." |
| S21 | Capitalization should be consistent. |
| S33 | Quotation marks should not be mismatched. |
| S34 | Each sentence must end with a period. |
| S42 | Whole numbers under ten should be spelled out (e.g., "two" instead of "2"). |
| S43 | There must be no missing words or extra words (e.g., "We did an experiment." not "We an experiment." or "We performed did an experiment.")  |
| S48 | There should be no repeated punctuation (e.g., "This sentence ends in two periods by mistake.."). |
| S57 | Nouns and pronouns should agree in terms of grammatical number (e.g., "robot" with "it" or "robots" with "they".) |
| S59 | Sources referenced in-text must follow the formats of "It is shown by Smith [4] ...", "The effect of ... should be taken into account [4].", "For example, see Refs. [6, 7].", "Further documentation can be found in [8-10].", or "This procedure was proposed by Gelb [11, p. 250]." |
| S60 | Use "Section III" (for example) when referring to a section. Use "Section III-B" (for example) when referring to a subsection. |
| S61 | There must be no missing space: words in a sentence must be separated by a space, there must be a single space after the end of a sentence, there must be a space between a parenthetical remark and the preceding word, there must be space between items (i.e., after each comma) in a comma-delimited list, there must be a space between words and citations (e.g., "blah [3]" not "blah[3]"), etc. |
| S62 | There must be no extra space: there must be only a single space and not a double space after the end of a sentence, there must be no space between punctuation (e.g., a comma, period, colon, semicolon, etc.) and the preceding word (e.g., "blah." not "blah ."), etc. |
| S63 | Numbered lists must be numbered consecutively (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...), without skipped numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 4, ...) or repeated numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 1, ...). |
| S64 | The word "data" is plural and must be used, for example, as "these data show" such-and-such and not as "this data shows" such-and-such. |
| S65 | A sentence should not begin with a numeral or a symbol; either spell it out or rephrase the sentence. |
| S66 | When commas are used to set off nonessential words or phrases, what remains must be a complete sentence. For example, "linear state feedback in the form, $u = - K x$, is implemented" is incorrect (because "linear state feedback in the form is implemented" is not a complete sentence), while "linear state feedback, $u = - K x$, is implemented" is correct (because "linear state feedback is implemented" is a complete sentence) and "linear state feedback in the form $u = - K x$ is implemented" is also correct (because no commas were used). |


## Figures and Tables

| Label | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| F1 | Plots must provide useful information (e.g., do not show a plot of a quantity that is constant, is always zero, or is saturated). |
| F2 | Each figure or table must be referenced at least once by number in the text. |
| F3 | Each figure or table must have a caption and a number. |
| F4 | Legends must not cover up plots or obscure results. |
| F5 | Labels in legends, axes, or tables should be descriptive names (text) or symbols (math) and should not be code variables (e.g., with underscores). |
| F6 | Figure captions must be written as one or more complete sentences that follow the same rules for grammar and punctuation as everything else. |
| F7 | Plots should not have titles — descriptions should go in captions, subcaptions, or legends. |
| F9 | The caption of a figure must be underneath the figure rather than above the figure. |
| F10 | The caption of a table must be above the table rather than below the table. |
| F11 | Table captions must be "definitive titles" (e.g., "Table 1  Buckling results for blade-stiffened panels"). In other words, unlike figure captions, table captions must not be a complete sentence, must have only the first word capitalized, and must have no period or other punctuation at the end. |
| F12 | Use both different colors and different line styles to distinguish lines within a plot or when sharing legends across subplots. This improves readability for everyone, including those with color blindness. |
| F13 | All lines in a plot should be labeled. |
| F14 | If two different lines in a plot show upper and lower bounds on the same quantity (e.g., minimum and maximum torque), these lines should have the same style and should correspond to only one label in the legend (rather than two labels, one for each line). |
| F15 | Side-by-side plots — particularly ones that show results for comparison (e.g., results for different choices of initial condition) — should be the same size and should have the same axis limits. |
| F16 | Subfigures should be referred to by letter (e.g., (a), (b), etc.) and not by position (e.g., "left" or "right"). |
| F17 | Plots must be either vectorized images (e.g., PDF or SVG) or high-resolution rasterized images (e.g., PNG) and must not be screenshots or other low-resolution images. |
| F18 | References to figures and tables in the text should be by number (e.g., "Fig. 1") and not by location (e.g., "the above figure"). Use “Figure” if it is the first word of a sentence and use “Fig.” if it is anywhere else. |
| F19 | Each figure or table must be numbered in the order of their appearance in the document. Figures and tables should be numbered separately — so, for example, if there are two figures and two tables appearing alternately in the paper, they should be numbered as Fig. 1, Table 1, Fig. 2, and Table 2, not as Fig. 1, Table 2, Fig. 3, and Table 4. |
| F20 | The font size of all text in a plot (e.g., legends, axis labels, etc.) should be both readable and close to the standard body text size. |
| F22 | The font of figure and table captions must be bold, but otherwise should be the same size and style as the standard body text. (e.g., It should be non-italic.) |
| F23 | Units must be provided, either in a legend or an axis label. |
| F24 | The caption of a table must be centered. |
| F25 | References in the text should not be made to figures or tables that do not exist in the report. |
| F26 | References in the text should be made to the figure or table that contains the information being discussed. |
| F27 | Units in legends must be consistent with units in axis labels. |
| F28 | Figures should not have text flowing around them. |
| F29 | In a plot, lines must be wide enough and markers large enough so that readers can see and distinguish between them without magnification. |
| F30 | Each figure or table must be centered. |
| F31 | Each figure or table must be complete (e.g., figures must have all axes visible and not cut off, tables must have all cells properly populated, etc.). |


## Content

| Label | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| C1 | When describing performance, either use words that are widely understood to have a precise technical meaning or provide a definition yourself (i.e., say what you mean). |
| C2 | Use italic upper-case "K" and "L" to denote the gain matrices for linear state feedback and linear observer (unless you clearly explain some alternative notation). |
| C4 | Specify both the "of what" and "with respect to what" when talking about derivatives (including Jacobians). |
| C5 | The abstract should provide a summary of key quantitative results (with actual numbers) that were obtained. Placeholders can be used in drafts when final results aren't available yet. |
| C6 | Do not provide unnecessary information about the computer, programming language, application, etc., that you used for implementation. |
| C7 | Theory should be in the Theory section, not also in the Introduction, the Experimental Methods, etc. |
| C8 | Provide enough information about the system to be controlled — including a clear description, a schematic, and a citation, for example — so that readers will understand even if they have not previously seen or worked with that system. Make sure all information provided is correct. (Note that it is usually best to describe the system exactly once, early in your report.) |
| C9 | Linear state feedback should be negative (i.e., "-Kx" and not "Kx") unless you clearly explain why you are taking a non-standard approach. |
| C10 | We strongly recommend that you follow the four-step process described on the course website (see Reference > State space models > How do I put a system in state space form?) to linearize the equations of motion. The order of this process, in particular, is important. For example, you cannot define the state "x" or input "u" of the state-space model without having first chosen an equilibrium point, because "x" and "u" are defined in terms of this equilibrium point. If you choose not to follow this four-step process, you must explain clearly and justify rigorously whatever alternative process you are using. |
| C11 | Our method of deriving a state space model requires linearizing about an equilibrium point that is both constant and known in advance. Any other method should be clearly explained and justified. |
| C13 | Be specific enough about your methods so that another engineer could reproduce them. |
| C14 | Only the real or imaginary part of an eigenvalue can be positive or negative, not the eigenvalue itself. |
| C15 | You must state (e.g., via pole placement, LQR, etc.) and justify your choice of gain matrix (e.g., by showing if the resulting closed-loop system is stable). |
| C23 | Variables must be defined in the text immediately before or after they are used, even if they are listed in the Nomenclature (that list is for reference — it collects all of the variables that are defined and used in the rest of the report). |
| C24 | Use specific criteria instead of subjective terms (e.g., good or bad, best or worst, etc.). |
| C30 | When plugging numerical values into a symbolic expression, either say what those values are (i.e., give the actual numbers) or provide a reference to where those values can be found (e.g., the course website, a github repository, code submitted as one of your final deliverables, etc.). |
| C33 | Our convention is to denote the state, input, and measurement of the nonlinear system by "m", "n", and "o" and to denote the state, input, measurement of the linearized system (i.e., the state-space model) by "x", "u", and "y". If you use a different convention, you must make that clear. Whatever notation you choose must clearly distinguish between the state, input, measurement of the nonlinear system and the state, input, and measurement of the linear system — these things are (in general) not the same. |
| C36 | Either clearly describe and rigorously justify any methods used or cite a reference that does this for you. Note that it is almost always better to cite a reference, if the method is not new and if a reference is available. In particular, it is likely impossible to provide a complete description of a method like eigenvalue placement or LQR in the context of a 6-page report (the reference page on the course website provides a minimally complete description, which is already too much for you to include) — use a citation for these sorts of things. |
| C37 | Nomenclature must list all variables used in the report along with their units enclosed in parentheses (unless a variable is dimensionless). |
| C40 | Do not define any given variable more than once in the Nomenclature. |
| C45 | If eigenvalue placement is used, you must clearly state and justify your choice of eigenvalue locations. (Eigenvalues must have negative real part and — if they have non-zero imaginary part — must be in complex conjugate pairs, but otherwise their location is an engineering decision. They could have zero or non-zero imaginary part, they could have a real part that is more negative or less negative, they could all be at the same location or could be at different locations, etc.)  |
| C46 | The gain matrix for linear state feedback K must have as many rows as there are inputs and as many columns as there are states. The gain matrix for linear observer L must have as many rows as there are states and as many columns as there are measurements, |
| C47 | Experiments must be described in enough detail that they could be understood and repeated by a colleague. |
| C49 | The length of each simulation must be stated. |
| C50 | The initial conditions for each simulation must be stated. If they were chosen randomly, specify how they were selected. For example, if chosen uniformly, specify the range; if drawn from a normal distribution, specify the mean and variance. |
| C51 | While it may be appropriate to describe experiments that were used to iterate on your control design, there must be a comprehensive set of experiments that validate your final control design (where "final" means "after you have stopped making changes"). |
| C52 | Quantitative results from many experiments (meeting the minimum project requirements, if such requirements are specified) — presented in figures and/or tables — should be used to support claims made in your report about the extent to which your control system "works" (however you have chosen to define that word). Results from only one experiment or a small number of experiments do not provide sufficient evidence in general. |
| C53 | You should make clear what "success" means (i.e., what it means for your controller to "work"), for example by providing a quantitative measure of performance. |
| C54 | Words like "optimal," "optimized," "optimization," etc., must not be used without first defining a quantity that is being maximized (e.g., a reward) or minimized (e.g., a cost). |
| C60 | The number of simulations performed must be stated and meet the minimum project requirements, particularly if these simulations are used to produce aggregate results (e.g., mean or standard deviation). |
| C65 | Experimental Methods should describe the experiments that were performed and should not present results. Results and Discussion should present the results that were obtained and should not describe the experiments. |
| C69 | Be specific about methods used. (For example, instead of saying that you "did calculations," say what you calculated and how you did it. Similarly, instead of saying that you "wrote code," say what it was that you implemented.) |
| C71 | Equations must be consistent with what is described in the text. (For example, if some eigenvalues in an equation do not have negative real part, the text should not claim that all eigenvalues have negative real part.) |
| C73 | If you present a result in Results and Discussion, you must describe the experiment that produced it in Experimental Methods. If you describe an experiment in Experimental Methods, you must present the results of that experiment in Results and Discussion. |
| C75 | Clearly define non-standard functions before they are used (e.g., "\lambda (A - BK)"). |
| C76 | If you apply LQR to design a controller, you must state and justify your choice of weights Q and R. (Remember that LQR computes K given Q and R — it doesn't compute Q and R or otherwise tell you what these weights should be.)  If your control system includes an observer, then these requirements apply to the dual LQR that determines the observer gain L as well. |
| C78 | If any work other than your own is used in your report (i.e. lecture notes, code, course website, textbook, articles, etc.), it must be cited in the References section. |
| C79 | Sources listed in the "References" section must be referenced within the text at least once. |
| C80 | The (nonlinear) equations of motion that describe the system to be controlled must be presented and correct. If these equations of motion are not already in standard form, then the process of putting them in standard form must be described and the result must be correct. |
| C81 | The choice of equilibrium point must be stated and correct. That is, assuming the equations of motion are written in standard form as $\dot{m} = f(m, n)$, the equilibrium point must be a choice of $m_e$ and $n_e$ for which $f(m_e, n_e) = 0$. The choice of equilibrium point must also be justified (making clear if other equilibrium points exist or if yours was the only possible choice). |
| C82 | The definition of the state x, the input u, and the measurement y in the state-space model that is produced by linearizing the equations of motion about an equilibrium point must be specified and must be correct. That is, assuming the equations of motion and measurement are written in standard forms as $\dot{m} = f(m, n)$ and $o = g(m, n)$ and given a choice $m_e$ and $n_e$ of equilibrium point of  the state m and the input n, the state, input, and measurement in the  state-space model must be $x = m - m_e$, $u = n - n_e$, and $y=  o - g(m_e, n_e)$. |
| C83 | The method of computing the matrices A and B that define the linearized dynamic model (e.g., expressions in terms of Jacobians) must be given and correct — a citation is insufficient. If you choose to show these matrices in your report — either the full matrices with numbers, or the structure of these matrices (e.g., which elements are zero or non-zero) — then these results must also be correct. If your control system includes an observer, then these requirements apply to the matrices C and D that define the linearized sensor model as well. |
| C84 | The elements of the state $m$, input $n$, and measurement $o$ of the (nonlinear) equations of motion and measurement, when written in standard forms as $\dot{m} = f(m, n)$ and $o = g(m, n)$, must be clearly defined. |
| C85 | The rank of the controllability matrix (or, some alternative measure like its determinant or its smallest singular value) must be stated, and the correct conclusion must be drawn about whether or not the state space model is controllable. |
| C86 | The final version of a report must be complete (e.g., it must not still include placeholders). |
| C87 | The description of variables and other quantities in the report must be correct. For example, $w_x$ denotes the $x$ component of angular velocity in a body-fixed reference frame and is not the same as the time derivative $\dot{\phi}$ of the roll angle. Similarly, the $\psi$ is a yaw angle — part of an Euler angle sequence (likely body-fixed), which is one way to represent the orientation of a rigid body or equivalently to parameterize a rotation matrix — and is not a "principal axis value." |
| C88 | The controllability matrix has as many rows as there are states, and as many columns as the product of the number of inputs and the number of states. It is computed by horizontally stacking B, AB, etc. |
| C89 | The "f" in the expression $\dot{m} = f(m, n)$ that describes equations of motion in standard form should be referred to as a "vector-valued function" and not as "a vector" or "a matrix." While it is acceptable to refer to "the function f" in text, it is unacceptable to say "f = ..." rather than "f(m, n) = ..." in an equation. The "g" in the expression $o = g(m, n)$ that describes a nonlinear sensor model should also be referred to (and denoted) as a vector-valued function. |
| C90 | A distinction must be made between the desired value $x_\text{des}$ of the linear state, which can vary with time (it can be chosen on-the-fly by the controller) and the equilibrium value $m_e$ of the nonlinear state, which must be both constant and chosen in advance. |
| C91 | The report must not mischaracterize technical concepts by using incorrect, ambiguous, or unusual language to describe them. For example, the thing that is produced by linearizing the equations of motion is a "dynamic model" and not a "model for the controller." Similarly, the thing that is produced by linearizing the measurement equations is a "sensor model" and not an "observer model." |
| C92 | References must be cited to support claims — for example, "attitude control is a critical challenge in modern space systems" or "a star tracker measures the positions of stars... and compares them to a known catalog" — for which you do not provide evidence (e.g., with derivations or experimental results). |
| C93 | The (nonlinear) measurement equations that describe output of sensors must  be presented and correct. (e.g., In DP 3, the measurement equations for each individual star and those for all stars must be distinguished and represented using different notations.) If these measurement equations are not already in standard form, then the process of putting them in standard form must be described and the result must be correct. |
| C94 | We strongly recommend that you follow the three-step process described on the course website (see Reference > State estimation > How do I linearize a sensor model?) to linearize the measurement equations. Remember that this process not only results in the computation of "C" and "D", but also in the definition of "y". If you choose not to follow this three-step process, you must explain clearly and justify rigorously whatever alternative process you are using. |
| C95 | The observability matrix has as many columns as there are states, and as many rows as the product of the number of outputs and the number of states. It is computed by vertically stacking C, CA, etc. (or by horizontally stacking C^T, (CA)^T, etc., and taking the transpose of the result). |
| C96 | The choice of actuators (e.g., the placement of reaction wheels on a spacecraft) and of sensors (e.g., the location of stars to be tracked) must be made before proceeding with model-based controller and observer design, because the dynamic model (used for controller design) and the sensor model (used for observer design) depend on these choices. A reason for these choices must also be given (e.g., why put a wheel here instead of there, why track three stars instead of five stars, etc.). |
| C97 | The rank of the observability matrix (or, some alternative measure like its determinant or its smallest singular value) must be stated, and the correct conclusion must be drawn about whether or not the state space model is observable. |
| C98 | If the true state is not known, the linear state feedback should be associated with the state estimate — i.e., use $-K \hat{x}$ instead of $-Kx$. |
| C99 | The description of experimental methods must be self-consistent. For example, you cannot say both that initial conditions were random and that initial conditions were not random (i.e., were chosen to be something in particular). |
| C100 | If the control system includes an observer, the choice of initial state estimate must be specified. |
| C101 | The review in the appendix "from the perspective of one or more of your cat-pilots" must be provided (e.g., prefaced by "stakeholders say"). It must not simply be a repeat of what was said previously (e.g., in the conclusion). |
| C102 | If the control system includes an observer, then the report must provide evidence — presented in figures and tables — both that the observer works (e.g., by looking at error in the state estimate) and that the controller works (e.g., by looking at error in the state). |
| C103 | If the control system includes an observer, then the report must distinguish between error in the state (i.e., the difference "x - 0" or "x - x_des") and error in the state estimate (i.e., the difference "xhat - x"). Otherwise, any reference to "error" is likely ambiguous. |
| C104 | The report must contain plots that are substantively different from those generated by template code. The plots in the template code are provided only as a starting point and are, in general, not acceptable for use in your report. Even if you modify their style (e.g., to avoid covering plot lines with legends or to label variables in legends with their python names and not with mathematical symbols), these template plots are unlikely to provide useful information. There will always be another choice of plot that is much more useful and much more effective than a template plot. |
| C105 | The report must contain figures and tables that are both meaningful and conceptually correct. For example, a histogram showing the distribution of time until failure does not directly show whether your controller and observer work, since there may be cases where the simulator runs without early termination even if the controller and observer fail to work (e.g., the cat pilot fails to dock). |
